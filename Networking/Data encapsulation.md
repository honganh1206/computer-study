A packet is born, then is wrapped/encapsulated in a header by the 1st protocol (e.g., TFTP) -> The while thing is encapsulated by the next protocol (UDP) -> Again by IP -> Final protocol on the hardware layer (Ethernet)

When a computer receives the packet, the hardware strips the packet and finally has the data.
