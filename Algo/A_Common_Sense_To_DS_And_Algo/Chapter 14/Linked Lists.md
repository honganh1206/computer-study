Instead of being a contiguous block of memory like arrays, the data from linked lists can be **scattered across different cells** throughout the computer’s memory. => Connected data that is dispersed throughout memory are known as **nodes**.

In a linked list, each node represents one item in the list. Each node also comes with a little extra information, namely, **the memory address of the next node** in the list (link).

A linked list’s first node can also be referred to as its **head**, and its final node as its **tail**.
