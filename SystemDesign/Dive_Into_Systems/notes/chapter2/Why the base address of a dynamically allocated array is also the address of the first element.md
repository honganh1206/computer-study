# Why the base address of a dynamically allocated array is also the address of the first element

TLDR: The base address **sets the initial location for each element** and **allows flexibility and efficiency in memory usage**

This design is to ensure _arrays can hold any number of elements as needed at runtime_. This flexibility aims to address potential issues with fixed-size declarations and efficient resource management

When we dynamically allocate an array, the system **manages memory on the fly** and not pre-allocate a fixed block, so that we avoid problems like unused space

In an array, each element stores a pointer pointing to the element after it, so the base address **determines where these pointers begin**

Here is the memory layout of an array

```c
array [0]: base address
array [1]: next address
array [2]: next address
...
 ...
array [99]: last address
```
[[Offset of elements in an array]]
