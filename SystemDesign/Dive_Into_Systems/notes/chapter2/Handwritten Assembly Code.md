# Handwritten Assembly Code

Assembly is low-level and depends on a particular hardware architecture

Programmers may write even faster assembly code than the C compiler can compile. Sometimes we write assembly code to access certain low-level parts e.g., specific registers

> [!TIP]
> Being able to read and understand a program's assembly code is an important skill. It helps us ontain a deeper understanding of what a program does + how it gets executed
