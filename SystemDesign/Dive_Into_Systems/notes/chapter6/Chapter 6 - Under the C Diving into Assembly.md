Assembly is the *closest* a programmer gets to coding at the machine level without writing code directly in 1s and 0s

A **compiler** translates a human-readable programming language (usually written in English) into a language that a computer understands. Most modern compilers produce assembly code that is as efficient as the handwritten assembly code

Why learning Assembly?

1. Lacking knowledge of Assembly often prevents a programmer from understanding valuable information on how a program runs
2. There are devices with processors so small that they cannot execute compiled code written by higher-level programming languages. Thus these devices require standalone assembly programs
3. Many avenues for attacking a program involve the way the program stores its runtime information. Thus we learn Assembly to understand how such vulnerabilities arise and how they can be exploited
4. Some system levels have handwritten assembly code where detailed machine-specific optimizations are critical for performance
