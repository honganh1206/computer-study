 If an attacker placed bytes associated with assembly instructions on the stack, *the CPU would mistake them as real instructions*, and we can force the CPU to execute arbitrary code.

Strategies against buffer overflow:

[[Stack randomization]]

[[Stack corruption detection]]

[[Limiting executable regions]]
