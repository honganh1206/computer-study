# Integer Byte Order

When storing a two-byte `short` variable `s`, with the bytes labeled `A` and `B` and two addresses `X` and `X + 1`, _the system must define which byte should occupy which address_

The **byte order/endianness** of a system defines _how its hardware assigns the bytes of a multibyte variable to consecutive memory addresses_ (More in [[Address of the object]])

The big-endian was adopted as the "network byte order" standard
