Storage systems often _group bits into longer sequences_ for storing more values, and one of the groupings is **bytes**

One byte represents $2^8=256$ unique values (0-255)

Bytes are the **smallest unit of addressable memory** in a computer system, so a program _cannot ask for fewer than 8 bits to store a variable_
