Always remember to allocate enough space for variables

When a system's main memory is not enough to store variables, *storage locations inside the CPU can be used as temporary scratch space*, but it is more constrained

As values get larger, storage devices need more wires to communicate signals between them. That is why *expanding storage increases the complexity of the hardware* + *leave less physical space for other components*
