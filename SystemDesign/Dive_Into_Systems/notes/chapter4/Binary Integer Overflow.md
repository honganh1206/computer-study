## Unsigned Overflow

If performing produces a smaller result, the addition has caused unsigned overflow

Shortcut: The $\text{Carry}_\text{in}$ must match the $\text{Carry}_{out}$

For addition ($\text{Carry}_{in} = 0$), the result should be **larger** than the 1st operand

For subtraction ($\text{Carry}_{in} = 1$), the result should be **smaller** than the 1st operand


## Signed Overflow

There is still a discontinuity in the modular number space, but because *a signed interpretation allows negatives, the discontinuity does not occur around 0*
