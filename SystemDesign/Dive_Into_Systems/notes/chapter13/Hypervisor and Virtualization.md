Hypervisor allows the host OS to run multiple virtual guest OSes.

Virtualization supports the host OS to manage the computer hardware in booting and running multiple OSes. Each guest OS has a private virtualized view of the underlying hardware.

The host OS's hypervisor support manages the virtualization, including protection and sharing of underlying physical resources among guest OSes.
