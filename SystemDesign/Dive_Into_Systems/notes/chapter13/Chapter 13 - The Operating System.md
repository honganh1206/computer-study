A *layer* sitting between the computer hardware and application programs. Its primary purpose is to *manage* the underlying hardware components to efficiently run program workloads.

The OS makes the computer *easy to use*: When the user double-clicks on an icon to start a program running on the underlying system, the OS *handles all the details of this operation* while hiding from users the low-level actions necessary to run the user's program.

The OS makes efficient use of system resources by implementing **multiprogramming**, which *allows more than a single program to run on the computer at a time*. How? The OS shares hardware resources among several programs running on the system.

To support multiprogramming, the OS needs to implement an *abstraction* of a running program called a **process**. The process abstraction enables the OS to *manage the set of multiple programs running in the system at any given time.*
