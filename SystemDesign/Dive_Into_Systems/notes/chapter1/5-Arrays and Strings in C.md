# 5-Arrays and Strings in C

The `sizeof` operator can be used on **any** C type including struct types to see _how much space a variable of that type needs_

> [!WARNING] > `printf` does not offer a placeholder for struct type, so we need to _individiually pass each field to printf_ like `printf("name: %s age: %d gpa: %g, year: %d\n", student1.name, student1.age, student1.gpa, student1.grad_yr);`
