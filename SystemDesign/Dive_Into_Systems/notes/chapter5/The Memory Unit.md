A key innovation - Store program data and program instructions that is **close to the processing unit**

A system's ISA limits the range of addresses it can express

In modern systems, the smallest addressable unit of memory is one byte/8 bits, and each address corresponds to one byte of storage

Thus, 32-bit architectures support a maximum address space of $2^{32}$, corresponding to 4 gigabytes of addressable memory 

At the moment we use the term "memory" to refer to RAM

Why RAM (Random Access Memory)? Because **all RAM storage locations/addresses can be accessed directly** as a linear array of addresses
