`NAND, NOR, XOR` are not necessary for building circuits, but they are commonly used in circuit design

Their functionality can be implemented by combining `AND, OR, NOT` gates into circuits

An example would be `A NOR B == NOT(A OR B)`

Today's integrated circuit chips have `NAND` as the basic building block of circuits on the chip
