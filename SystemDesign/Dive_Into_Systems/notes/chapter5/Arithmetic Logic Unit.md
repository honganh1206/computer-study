The ALU implements arithmetic and logic operations on both signed and unsigned integers, while *a separate floating-point unit* deals with arithmetic operations on floating-point values

The ALU takes an **opcode** (specify operation to perform) and integer operand values

Output of ALU: The resulting value of the operation and **[[Condition code]] values** that *encode information about the result*

The secret sauce: The [[ALU combines arithmetic and logic circuits with a multiplexer circuit]] to pick the ALU's output
