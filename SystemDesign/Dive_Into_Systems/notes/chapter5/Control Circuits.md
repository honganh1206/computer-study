What do they do?

- Drive the execution of program instructions on program data
- Control loading & storing values to different levels of storage
- Control hardware devices

 The CPU uses a  [[Multiplexer]] circuit to select from *which CPU register to read an instruction operand value*

[[N-way 1-bit MUX circuits]]

[[Chaining gates]]

[[Demultiplexer]]

[[Designing a 4-bit arithmetic negation circuit]]

A 16-way multiplexer will need $\log_{2}(16) = 4$ selection bits
