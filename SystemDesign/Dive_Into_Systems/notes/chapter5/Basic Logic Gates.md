Logic gates implement Boolean operations (`AND/OR/NOT`) on Boolean operands (0 and 1)

| A   | B   | A AND B | A OR B | NOT A |
| --- | --- | ------- | ------ | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0       | 0      | 1     |
| 0   | 1   | 0       | 1      | 1     |
| 1   | 0   | 0       | 1      | 0     |
| 1   | 1   | 1       | 1      | 0     |

A multibit version of a logic gate (for $M$-bit input and output) is a circuit constructed using $M$ one-bit logic gates
