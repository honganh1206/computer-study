Whereas a multiplexer chooses one of $N$ inputs, *a demultiplexer chooses one of $N$ outputs*

Based on the value of S, the DMUX sends the input value to **exactly** one of its $N$ outputs by routing the input to one of the outputs

A **decoder** circuit takes one encoded input and enables one of several outputs

For example, a decoder circuit that has a $N$-bit input value will use S to enable *exactly one* of its $2^N$ inputs
