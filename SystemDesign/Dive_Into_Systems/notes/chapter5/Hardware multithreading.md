A single-processor design that supports *executing multiple hardware [[Threads]]*

Hardware multithreaded microarchitectures are based on superscalar processors, which have multiple pipelines and multiple execution units to execute instructions from several threads *simultaneously*. This results in IPC > 1

Multithreaded architectures implement [[Interleaved multithreading]]. Such microarchitectures share a pipeline and always share the processor's single ALU (the CPU switches between executing different threads on the ALU)
