Digital circuits implement the ISA in hardware, and also the storage and control functionality throughout the system

Designing digital circuits involves multiple levels of abstraction: We built a circuit from smaller circuits, and such circuits are built from even smaller circuits and so on. The bottom line is basic logic gate building blocks
