A small set of basic instructions that execute quickly -> This is a radical departure from a commonly held notion that ISAs needed to be increasingly comple

Each instruction executes in about a *single processor clock cycle*

Compilers combine sequences of several basic RISC instructions to implement higher-level functionality
