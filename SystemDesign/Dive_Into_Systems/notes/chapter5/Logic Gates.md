The building blocks of the digital circuitry

A designer creates simple circuits that implement basic functionality from a small set of basic logic gates -> Such simple circuits, abstracted from the implementation, are then used to create more complicated circuits -> Complex circuits are then abstracted and used to build even more complicated functionality
