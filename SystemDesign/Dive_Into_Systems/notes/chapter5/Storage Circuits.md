We have two types of computer memory: [[SRAM and DRAM]]

To store a value, a circuit must contain a **feedback loop** so that the value is retained by the circuit

When a storage circuit stores a value, its currently stored value and its input together produce an output that *matches the currently stored value*

When a new value is being written to a circuit, the input value *changes momentarily* to modify the behavior of the circuit to store the new value. After that, the circuit resumes the state of storing the new value until the next write
