CPU pipelining enables **instruction-level parallelism** (ILP) in which the CPU *simultaneously executes multiple instructions* by *overlapping* their execution in the pipeline

A simple pipelined CPU can achieve a CPI of 1, meaning executing one instruction every clock cycle. Modern microprocessors employ pipelining with other ILP techniques + include multiple CPU cores to achieve CPI < 1

The number of transistors that can fit on a chip is a rough measure of its performance

According to *Moore's Law*, the number of transistors per integrated circuits doubles *every two year*, which leads to twice as much space for storage + computation circuitry
