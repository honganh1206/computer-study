Drive the execution of program instructions by *loading them from memory* and *feeding instruction operands (e.g., memory addresses)  and operations (e.g., `ADD, MOV, LOAD`)* through the processing unit

The **program counter** keeps the memory address of the next instruction to execute

The **instruction register** stores the instructions (being executed) loaded from memory
