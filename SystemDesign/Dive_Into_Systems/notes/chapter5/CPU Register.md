A multibit storage circuits are built by *linking several 1-bit storage circuits together*

We construct a 32-bit storage circuit by combining 32 1-bit [[Gated D Latch]] circuits together

Example below shows a 32-bit data input `D` and 1-bit input WE producing a 32-bit value stored across 32 1-bit D latches
