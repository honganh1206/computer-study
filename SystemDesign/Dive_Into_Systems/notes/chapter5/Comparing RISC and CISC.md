RISC contain more total instructions to execute, but each instruction executes much more efficiently than most CISC instructions

CISC microarchitectures are designed to execute more complicated instructions, but they require more complex microarchitecture designs and faster clock rates

In general, RISC processors are more efficiently designed and offer better performance, but CISC is still the dominant ISA with larger support

While CISC remains dominant, RISC are more commonly seen in high-end servers and mobile devices with ARM architecture due to their low power requirements
