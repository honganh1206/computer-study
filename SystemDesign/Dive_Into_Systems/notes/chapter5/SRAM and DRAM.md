**Static RAM (SRAM)** for CPU register storage and on-chip cache and **Dynamic RAM (DRAM)** for main memory (RAM) storage

Why the "dynamic" moniker? The capacitor-based (storing electricity) design of DRAM requires it to be *periodically refreshed with the values it stores*

On the other hand, SRAM's design is circuit-based and it does not need its values to be periodically refreshed, hence the "static"

SRAM is faster but more resource-expensive, so SRAM tends to be for storage *at the top of the memory hierarchy* like CPU registers and on-chip cache memory
