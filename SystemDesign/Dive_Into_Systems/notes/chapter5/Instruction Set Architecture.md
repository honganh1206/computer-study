The **instruction set architecture** (ISA) is implemented by a particular digital processor.

The architecture defines:

- The set of instructions and their binary encoding
- The set of CPU registers
- The effects of executing instructions on the state of the processor

Different ISAs include IA32, ARM, ARC, and x86 (many more)

Some ISAs define a [[Reduced Instruction Set Computer - RISC]] and others define a [[Complex Instruction Set Computer - CISC]]
