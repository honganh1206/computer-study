The CPU executes the program instructions on program data, which is stored in RAM

[[Instruction Set Architecture]]

What we do:
- Build an example digital processor (CPU) based on the von Neumann architecture
- Design a CPU from digital circuits from logic gate building blocks
- Demonstrate how the CPU executes program instructions
