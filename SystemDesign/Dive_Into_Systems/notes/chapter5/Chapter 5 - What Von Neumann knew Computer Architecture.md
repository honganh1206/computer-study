The CPU executes the program instructions on program data, which is stored in RAM

[[Instruction Set Architecture]]

What we do:
- Build an example digital processor (CPU) based on the von Neumann architecture
- Design a CPU from digital circuits from logic gate building blocks
- Demonstrate how the CPU executes program instructions

Today's modern processors are based on the von Neumann architecture, which defines an universal computer. This general-purpose design allows the processors to execute any type of program

[[The von Neumann Architecture]]

Logic gates are the basic building blocks to implement a digital processor. A digital processor's functionality is built by combining control + storage + arithmetic/logic circuits. All of this is run by a clock circuit that drives the Fetch, Decode, Execute and WriteBack phases

[[The Processor executes program instructions]]

Today's microprocessors use a variety of techniques to improve processor performance like pipelined execution, instruction-level parallelism and multicore design
