A direct-mapped cache *divides its storage space into units* called the **cache lines**

The cache might hold from dozens to thousands of cache lines depending on its size.

Two types of information: A [[Cache data block]] and [[Cache metadata]]

[[Reading cached data]]

[[Writing to Cached Data]]

> A direct-mapped cache has multiple sets, but each set contains *exactly one line*
