Regarding modern computer storage, *devices with higher capacities offer lower performance*.

*No single device can be both fast and able to store a large amount of data*. Similarly, storage devices trade cost (bytes per dollar and operational cost i.e., energy use) and storage density. For example: While caches offer great performance, building a CPU with a large enough cache to store main memory is infeasible.

While programmers prefer not to be worried about where their data resides (which could be agonizing), sometimes it might be worth the effort to *micromanage which type of memory each variable occupies*
