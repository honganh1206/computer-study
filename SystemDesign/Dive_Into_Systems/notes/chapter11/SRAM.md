SRAM stores data in *small electrical circuits* (refer to [[RS Latch]]).

 > SRAM in this context does not mean a part of a computer, but more like a *concept*. In this sense, registers could also be SRAM.

CPU designers integrate it directly into the CPU to build [[Registers]] and caches.

SRAM is expensive to build, to operate, and in the amount of space it occupies.
