Secondary storage devices connect to a system that is *farther away from the CPU and main memory*, and they have more diverse designs than other components e.g., [punch card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card), [tape drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape_data_storage) and [floppy disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk)

 Secondary storage device characteristics (2020 workstation)

| Device                | Capacity            | Latency     | Transfer rate                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Flash disk            | 0.5 - 2 terabytes   | 0.1 - 1 ms  | 200 - 3,000 megabytes / second |
| Traditional hard disk | 0.5 - 10 terabytes  | 5 - 10 ms   | 100 - 200 megabytes / second   |
| Remote network server | Varies considerably | 20 - 200 ms | Varies considerably            |

Example of how a secondary storage connects to the main memory: A hard disk connects to a Serial ATA controller, which connects to the system I/O controller, which connects to the memory bus.
