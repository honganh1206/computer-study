Consider the following characteristics:

- 16-bit memory address
- A two-way set associative cache with 64 sets
- 32-byte cache blocks
- LRU policy with 0 for leftmost line as LRU and 1 for rightmost line as LRU

Example: 1. Read from address 1010000001100100

32-byte block size -> Rightmost 5 bits `00100` of the address ($\log_{2}32 = 5$) comprise the offset portion 

64-set cache -> Next six bits `000011` comprises the index portion 

Remaining bits `10100` for the tag

Both lines at index 000011 (set 3) are invalid, so the request misses, and the cache loads data from main memory. The setâ€™s LRU bit is 0, so the cache loads data into the left line and updates the LRU bit to 1.
