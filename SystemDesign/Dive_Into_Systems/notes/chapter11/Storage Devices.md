**Primary storage devices** can be *accessed directly* by a program on the CPU. Examples are CPU registers and RAM

However, the CPU cannot directly refer to **secondary storage devices** and must request a copy of the data into the primary storage. Examples are HDDs and SSDs.

Important criteria to classify memory devices: **Capacity** - The amount of data a device can store | **Latency** - The amount of time a program needs to respond with data | **Transfer rate** - The amount of data that can be moved


The performance variance is mostly due to the *distance* and *variations in the technologies* used to implement the devices

> Computing devices need to be small in order to be fast. Refer to [Grace Hopper's "Nanoseconds"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eyFDBPk4Yw)

Registers and caches are built from relatively simple circuits, and their small size and minimal complexity *ensure electrical signals can propagate through them quickly*. On the opposite end of the spectrum, traditional hard disks contain magnetic platters that can store hundreds of gigabytes, but with high access latency due to the requirements to *mechanically aligning and rotating components into the correct positions*
