**Heterogeneous computing** is computing using multiple, different processing units found in a computer? The processing units might have different ISAs, and some managed by the OS while others not.

Heterogeneous computing means support for parallel computing using CPU cores and [[Accelerator units]] such as GPUs or **field programmable gate arrays** (FPGAs).

> [!info]
> It is increasingly common to implement heterogeneous computing solutions to large, data-intensive and computation-intensive problems. Making use of the processing capabilities of both the CPU and accelerator units can increase the degree of parallel execution.
