Special-purpose hardware optimized for certain devices or to perform specialized types of processing.

## FPGAs

An *integrated circuit* consisting of gates, memory and interconnection components.

*Reprogrammable*, so they can be reconfigured to implement specific functionality in hardware.

Require less power to run than a CPU

Implementation examples: Device controller, sensor data processing, cryptography, etc.

*Low-latency*, so they can be directly connected to system buses to implement fast parallel computation.

Downside: Reprogramming FPGAs takes a long time and limited use.

## [[Graphics Processing Units]] and Cell Processors

A Cell processor is a *multicore processor* consisting of one general-purpose processor and multiple co-processors specialized to accelerate a specific type of computation. Example is the Playstation 3 using the Cell processors for fast graphics.
