# Scalability

A system's ability to **code with increased load**.

A program is scalable if we see improving/constant performance as we increases the number of resources.

A **strongly scalable** program has an *improvement* in performance when we increase the number of cores/processing units on a *fixed* problem. 

A **weakly scalable** program shows a constant or an improvement in performance when we increase the size of the data at the same rate as the number of cores.

> "Weak" and "strong" in this context do not indicate the quality of a program's scalability, but are different ways to measure scalability.
