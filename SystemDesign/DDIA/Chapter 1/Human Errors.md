# Human Errors

- Human errors are inevitable: We are humans after all!
- Some ways to minimize this:

1. Design systems in a way that **minimizes opportunities for errors**
2. Decouple places where people make most mistakes
3. Test thoroughly (ofc!)
4. Design to **allow quick and easy recovery** e.g., make it fast to roll back configuration changes
5. Set up detailed and clear monitoring
6. Implement good management practices
