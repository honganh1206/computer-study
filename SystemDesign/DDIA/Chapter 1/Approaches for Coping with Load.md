# Approaches for Coping with Load

> How do we maintain good performance even when our load parameters increase by some amount?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For every order of magnitude load increase, you will need to **rethink your architecture**

Good architectures usually involve **a pragmatic mixture of approaches** like scaling up/scaling out/shared-nothing architecture. An example is using a number of fairly powerful machines > a large number of small virtual machines
