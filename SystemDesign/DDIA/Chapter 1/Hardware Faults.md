# Hardware Faults

- Hard disks have a mean time to failure (MTTF) of 10~50 years. 
- While there are different approaches to this like *adding redundancy*, this approach still cannot prevent hardware problems.
- The trend: Moving towards system that can *tolerate the loss of entire machines* with one advantage: No need for planned downtime when updating/fixing
