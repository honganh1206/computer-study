The following C code will be compiled to this on different systems:


```c

	return x + y;
}

```


```
Linux 32 - 55 89 e5 8b 45 0c 03 45 08 c9 c3
Windows - 55 89 e5 8b 45 0c 03 45 08 5d c3
Sun 81 - c3 e0 08 90 02 00 09
Linux 64 - 55 48 89 e5 89 7d fc 89 75 f8 03 45 fc c9 c3
```


Be aware that even with identical processors, **compiling this code in different OSes might lead to differences** and hence not binary-compatibility.
