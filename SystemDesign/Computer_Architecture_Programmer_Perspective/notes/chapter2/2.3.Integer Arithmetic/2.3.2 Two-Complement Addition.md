We decide what to do when the result is either too large (positive) or too small (negative) to represent.

For values $x, y$ such that $-2^{w-1} \leq x,y \leq 2^{w-1}-1$, their sum will be in the range $-2^{w}\leq x + y \leq 2^{w}- 2$, which *potentially* requires $w+1$ bits to represent. We thus need to *truncate the representation* to $w$ bits.
