An **abstraction** that provides each process with the **illusion** that *each process has an exclusive use of the main memory*.

Each process has a [[Virtual address space]] (an uniform view of memory) in which instructions and data are stored. We can think of those spaces as an array of addressable bytes from address 0 to some maximum address like $2^{31}-1$ for 32-bit systems.

> Processes cannot access the contents of one another's address spaces

While the topmost region is for **code and data in the OS that is common to all processes**, the lower region holds the **code and data defined by the user’s process**

The virtual address space consists of certain areas with some of these lowest areas:
- [[Program code and data]]
- [[Heap and Stack]]
- [[Shared libraries]]
- [[Kernel virtual memory]]

The virtual memory works by **a series of interactions** between the hardware and the OS, one of them is the hardware translates every address generated by the processor.

> Contents of a process’ virtual memory is stored on disk and we use the main memory (RAM) as a cache for the disk. => Frequently accessed data will be stored in the main memory, while the slower one is on disk. (More on [[Chapter 9]])

The lone view abstraction: Each process only interacts with memory in terms of its own virtual address space rather than sharing the computer's RAM.
