> - A **process** is an abstraction of a running program and its code is executed by either an **uniprocessor** (1 CPU/core), in which the **kernel** takes control to perform requested operation before giving control back to the program.
> - A **virtual memory** is an abstraction for the **inclusive use of main memory** of each process, and each process has a **virtual address space** in which certain **areas** like **stack**, **heap**, **kernel virtual memory** are responsible for *interactions between the OS and the hardware*.
> - A **thread** is an **execution unit** of a process and multiple threads can *share data between each other* in one thread context.


Both the shell program and the `hello` program interact with components e.g., keyboard, display, disk, etc. via the OS. **All attempts** by an application program to affect the hardware must go through the OS. (Figure 1.10)

Two primary purposes of the OS:
1. Protect the hardware from misuse by applications
2. Provide applications with simple + uniform mechanisms to manipulate hardware devices

The OS achieves both goals via these fundamental abstractions: [[Processes]], [[Threads]], [[Virtual Memory]] and [[Files]]
