The kernel is resident in memory. 
→ When the app executes a special **system call** instruction to the OS as it requires some actions, the control is passed to the kernel.
→ The kernel performs the requested operations then passes the control back to the program


> [!note] Kernel != process
> The kernel is not a process but a collection of code and data structures that the system uses to manage all the processes.
