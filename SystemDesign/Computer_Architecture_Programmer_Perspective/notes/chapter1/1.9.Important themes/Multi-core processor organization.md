Multi-core processors have a number of CPUs (now referred as **cores**) *integrated onto a single integrated-circuit chip*

Figure 1.17 shows a multi-processor with 4 cores, *each with its own L1 and L2 caches*. Each L1 cache is divided into 2 parts: One to hold **recently fetched instructions** and one to hold **data**. The L3 cache is *shared by all core*s as well as the interface to the main memory

> In the future, we might have *hundreds of cores on a single chip*.
