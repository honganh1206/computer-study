An example of abstraction: The instruction set architecture is an abstraction for the actual processor hardware.

=> [[This abstraction makes a processor appear to perform one instruction at a time]]

Some other abstractions:
1. Files as an abstraction of I/O devices
2. Virtual memory as an abstraction of program memory
3. Processes as an abstraction of running programs
4. (New) Virtual machine as an abstraction of the entire computer
