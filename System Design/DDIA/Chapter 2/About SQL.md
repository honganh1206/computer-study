# About SQL

SQL is based on the [relational model proposed by Edgar Codd in 1970](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf)
Roots of relational data base is **business data processing**. Use cases involve **transaction processing** e.g., banking transactions, airline reservations, etc., and **batch processing** e.g., customer invoicing, payroll, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We as developers need to _think a lot about the internal representation of the data_ in the database

The _goal_ of the relational model was to **hide the implementation behind a clean interface**
