# How is it represented in terms of the next-lower layer

As application developers, we look at the real world and model it in in terms of _objects and data structures_. Such structures are often **specific to your application**

We then express such structures in general-purpose data model like JSON or XML documents, tables, etc.

The database software engineer decides a _way of representing_ that JSON/XML/graphs in terms of bytes in memory, on disk, etc. so the data can be queried, manipulated, and processed in various ways

On an even lower level, hardware engineers have figured out how to represent bytes in terms of electrical currents, pulses of light, etc.
