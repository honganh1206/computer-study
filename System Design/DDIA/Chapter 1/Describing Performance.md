## Describing Performance

Two ways to look at: **When we increase a load parameter and we keep the system resources/performance, how is the performance/system resources affected?**
For batch processing systems, we care about **throughput** i.e., number of records we can process per second (ideally, running time = size of data set / throughput)

For online systems, **response time** is more important
