# From stateful to stateless

Taking stateful data systems from a single node to a distributed setup can _introduce additional complexity_. However, distributed systems will become the default in the future, even for cases that do not handle high-volume traffic

> [!TIP] Scale before going distributed
> Common wisdom is to _keep your database in a single node and scale up_ until scaling cost or high-availability requirements forces you to make it distributed
