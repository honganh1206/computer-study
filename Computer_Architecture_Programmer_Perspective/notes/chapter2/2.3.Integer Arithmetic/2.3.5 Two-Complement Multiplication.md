For $x, y$ in the range $-2^{w-1} \leq x, y \leq 2^{w-1} - 1$ represented as $w$-bit two's-complement numbers, their product can range between:

$$
-2^{2w-2} + 2^{w-1} \leq x \times y \leq 2^{2w-2}
$$
We can see that this could require $2w$ bits to represent in two's-complement form. In C, this will be truncated from $2w$ bits to $w$ bits by *computing its value modulo $2^w$ then converting from unsigned to two's-complement*.

## Principle

$$
x ~ *^{t}_{w} ~ y = \text{U2T}_{w}((x\times y)\text{mod}2^{w})
$$

Notably, the bit-level representation of the product operation is **identical** for both unsigned and two's-complement multiplication. The following principle demonstrates it:
