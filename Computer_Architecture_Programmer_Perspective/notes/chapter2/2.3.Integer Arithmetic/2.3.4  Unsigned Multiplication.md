For $x, y$ in the range $0 \leq x, y \leq 2^{w}-1$, their product can range between:
$$
0 \leq x \times y \leq (2^{w}-1)^2
$$

Truncating an unsigned number to $w$ bits is equivalent to *computing its value modulo $2^{w}$*. For $0 \leq x, y \leq U\text{Max}_{w}$

$$
x ~\star ^{u}_{w} ~y = (x\times y)\text{mod}2^{w}
$$
