Almost all machines use twoâ€™s-complement and most numbers are signed. We create an unsigned constant by *adding the character U* like `12345U` or `0x1A2BU`

C allows casting from signed to unsigned and vice versa while following the rule that *the underlying bit representation does not change* (See more in [[The bit values are kept identical - We only change how the computer interprets the values]]).

The casting can happen **explicitly** or **implicitly**:


```c
int tx, ty;
unsigned ux, uy;

// Explicit casting
tx = (int) ux;
uy = (unsigned) ty;

// Implicit casting
tx = ux; /* Cast to signed */
uy = ty; /* Cast to unsigned */
```

`printf` in C *does not make use of any type information*, meaning we can print a value of type `int` with the directive `%u`


```c
// On 32-bit program
int x = -1;
unsigned u = 2147483648;
printf("x = %u = %d\n", x, x); // x = 4294967295 = -1
printf("u = %u = %d\n", u, u); // u = 2147483648 = -2147483648

```

The two conversions still work as expected: $T 2 U_{w}(x) = UMax_{w} = 2^{w}- 1$ and $U 2 T_{w}(x) = 2^{w-1} - 2^w$.
