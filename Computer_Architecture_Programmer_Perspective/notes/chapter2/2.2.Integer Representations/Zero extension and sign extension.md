## Principles

Operation zero extension is when we *add leading zeros to the representation*, while operation sign extension is to *add copies of the most significant bit to the representation*.


[[Expansion of an unsigned number by zero extension]]

[[Expansion of a twoâ€™s-complement number by sign extension]]

Note that conversing data from one data size to another and between signed and unsigned can *affect the behavior of the program*.
