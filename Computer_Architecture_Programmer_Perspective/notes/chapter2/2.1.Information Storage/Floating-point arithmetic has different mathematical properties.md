> Overflow will yield the special value of $+\infty$

- Floating-point arithmetic is **not associative** due to the *finite precision of the representation.*
	- Example: The expression $3.14+(1e20-1e20)$ will evaluate to $3.14$

- While integer representations can encode a small range of values but with high precision, floating-point representations can encode a wide range of value but **only with approximation**.
