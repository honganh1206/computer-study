Numeric constants starting with **0x** or **0X** are interpreted as *being in hexadecimal*. The characters from A to F may be *written in either upper- or lowercase*. We could write  FA1D37B<sub>16</sub> as  `0xFA1D37B` or `0xfa1d37b` or mixing up with `0xFa1D37b`

> We will use C notation to represent hexadecimal values in this book!
