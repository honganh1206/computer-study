A string in C is *encoded by an array of characters that are terminated by the null (value 0) character*. 

**Null character** `'\0'` is a special character used in C to *signify the end of a string*. It helps string length calculation in linear time, memory management and interoperability with other languages.

Each character in a string is represented by standard coding like ASCII (most common one)

For example, when we use `show_bytes((byte_pointer) &"12345", 6);`, the result will be `31 32 33 34 35 00`. Two interesting things here:

1. The ASCII code for a decimal $x$ will be in the form of 0x3$x$
2. The terminating byte will be represented as 0x00

And **this representation will be obtained on ANY systems using ASCII as its character code**
