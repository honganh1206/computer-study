# Information Is Bits + context

- All computer systems (Yes, ALL) share similar hardware and software components that perform similar functions

![[Pasted image 20240830161132.png|Most computer systems represent text characters using ASCII standard with each character represented with a unique byte-size integer value]]


- The source program (`hello.c`) is **a sequence of bits**, each with a value of 0 or 1, organized in 8-bit chunks called **bytes**

```
Character:  'H'   |  'i'
ASCII Code:  72   |  105
Binary:    01001000 | 01101001

Visualized Bytes:
         | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   (H)
         | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |   (i)

```

- Files like `hello.c` (with ASCII characters) are considered *text files*, while other files are known as *binary files*

> [!important]

> All information in a system (disk files, programs stored in memory, user data, data transferred across a network, etc.) is represented as a bunch of bits.

- In different contexts, the same sequence of bytes might represent different things.

```
01000001 01000010

# In ASCII text , these are "AB"
# In integer representation, these are an unsigned 16-bit integer 16706
