## PP 1.1

A. As 1500km used to consume 60% of the time ($\alpha = \frac{1500}{2500} = 0.6$) but the speed is improved by x1.5 ($k = \frac{150}{100} = 1.5$), the speed up will be:
$$
S = \frac{1}{(1-0.6)+\frac{0.6}{1.5}}=1.25X
$$



B. We have $S=1.67X$ then $k=\frac{0.6}{\frac{1}{1.67} - 0.4}=3$ so the new velocity must be **300km/hr**


## PP 1.2

We have $S=4$ and as only 90% of the engine can be improved, which means the part to be improved requires 90% of the total time ($\alpha=0.9$). So we performance factor $k=6$.
