## Key features:

- Reasoning (Model)
- Acting (Model + SDK + Tools)
- Observing (Code + SDK)
- Planning (Model)
- Collaborating (Code + SDK)
- Self-refining (Model)

## How do AI agents work?

- Persona/Profile - To maintain a consistent character and behave in a manner appropriate to its assigned role (Done by prompts/profile settings?)
- Memory - Short term (in-memory storage for immediate interactions), long term (disks for historical data and conversation), consensus (shared information among agents), episodic memory (past interactions)
- Tools 
- Models

## Types of AI agents

### Based on interaction

Surface agents (Interactive partners): Do tasks like customer service, healthcare, etc. with tasks like Q&A, chit chat and world knowledge interactions with humans

Background agents (Autonomous background processes): Automate routine tasks, analyze data, identify and address potential issues. Include workflow agents. Limited  or no human interaction. Driven by events and tasks

-> Coding agent is a combination of both?

### Based on number of agents

Single agent: Operate independently to achieve a specific goal. Handle only one foundational model for its processing

Multi-agent: Multiple AI agents collaborate or compete to achieve a common objective. Simulate human behaviors such as interpersonal communication 


## Challenges

Tasks required deep empathy/emotional intelligence or complex human interaction

Situations with high ethical stakes

Domains with unpredictable physical environments like surgery

Resource-intensive applications
