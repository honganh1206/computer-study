 Agentic AI Architecture is a **blueprint** to build systems where AI agents interact with their environment and execute decisions efficiently

Building blocks are in modules: Perception - Cognitive - Action

## Connecting the components

1. Data collection and Pre-processing + Cleanup (Code)
2. Perception and Feature extraction (Code/SDK)
3. Goal representation and planning (Prompting)
4. Decision-making (Model)
5. Action execution (Code/SDK + Model + Tools)
6. Learning and adaptation (Code to handle memory + Model)

## Layers

Input Layer - Gather user interactions and real-time data streams

Agent Orchestration Layer - Coordinate AI agents for adaptive tasks

Data storage & Retrieval Layer - Distributed repositories or vector stores

Output Layer - Transform AI insights into context-aware results (Profile?)

Service Layer - Deliver AI capabilities across platforms (APIs)

## Challenges

Ethical considerations

Security

Complexity management when integrating various models and technologies

## Agentic architectural models

Hierarchical - A central "conductor" agent overseeing the actions of other agents

Decentralized - Agents operate as equals

## Agentic frameworks

Enable AI systems to operate autonomously in dynamic environments e.g., LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.

## Agentic Design Pattern

A reusable template for building AI systems where agents interact with tools, environments, and sometimes with each other
