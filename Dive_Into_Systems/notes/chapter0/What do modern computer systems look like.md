Two types of computer hardware systems: A desktop computer and a laptop computer

Both share the same hardware components, though some of the components have a smaller form factor or more compact

The trend in computer hardware design is **toward smaller and more compact devices**. An example is a Raspberry Pi single-board computer

All computer systems nowadays (including smartphones) have **multicore** processors and their CPUs are capable of \_executing multiple programs simultaneously. And all of them can run one or more **general-purpose OSes** such as macOS, Windows or Unix
