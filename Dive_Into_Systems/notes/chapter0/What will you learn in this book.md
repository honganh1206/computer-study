## How a computer runs a program

How a program written in a high-level language gets executed by the low-level circuitry of the computer hardware

- How program data gets encoded into binary for hardware to perform arithmetic on it
- How a compiler translates C programs to assembly (human-readable form of binary machine code)
- How a CPU executes binary instructions
- How the OS implements the interface for users to run programs

## Evaluate systems costs associated with a program's performance (Chapter 5)

- How the memory hierarchy works and its impact on program performance
- How the OS costs is associated with program performance
- Tips on code optimization
- How to design programs that use system resources effectively
- How to evaluate costs associated with program execution

## Leverage the power of parallel computers with parallel programming

- How to exploit multiple cores on the CPU to make the programs run faster
- How to design parallel programs and write multithreaded parallel programs using Pthreads
- Introduction to other types of parallel systems and parallel programming models
