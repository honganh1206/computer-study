# Tokens

A token is a **subsequence of characters** in a string separated by any number of delimiter characters of the programmer's choosing

Consider the string "hello world". We can split it into multiple tokens with specific delimiters, such as spaces:

- Tokens could be "hello", " ", "world".

Or without delimiters:

- Tokens would be "h", "e", "llo", "o", "w", etc.

Another example is the string "abcdefg":

- Tokens can be split into "a", "bc", "defg" if using a delimiter like commas.
