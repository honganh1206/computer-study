# Pass by value

All arguments in C are **passed by value** and **follow pass-by-value semantics**

The parameter only gets a **copy** of a value, and modifying the parameter's value does NOT change its argument's value

When passing base type values like `int`, changing the value stored in the parameter does NOT change the value stored in its argument
