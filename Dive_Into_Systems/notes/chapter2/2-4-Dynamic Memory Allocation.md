# 2-4-Dynamic Memory Allocation

Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) allows a C program to **request more memory as it's running** and a pointer variable to **store the address of the dynamically allocated space**

DMA _grants flexibility_ to programs that:

- Do not know the size of specific data structures until runtime
- Need for a variety of input sizes
- Need to allocate _exactly_ the size of data structures needed for a particular execution
- Grow/shrink the sizes of memory allocated when the programs run
