![[Pasted image 20231001112307.png]]

- Designed to
	- Detect malicious traffic and block it while allowing legitimate users to connect
	- **Prevent additional cost** for auto-scaling environments => Scale out costs during DDoS attack are covered and customer will get the cost credit back for those scaled out resources
- Two tiers
	- Basic - Automatically enable for Azure platform
	- Standard - Add mitigation & monitoring capabilities for Azure Virtual Network resources
- Standard tier uses Machine Learning to **analyze traffic patterns** for better accuracy
