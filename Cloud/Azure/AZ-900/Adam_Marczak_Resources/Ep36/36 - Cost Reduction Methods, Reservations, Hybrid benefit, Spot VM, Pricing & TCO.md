	- Reserved instances - Azure VMs
	- Reserved capacity - Azure storage, SQL Database vCores, Cosmos DB RUs, etc.

# Spot VM

- How it works
	- Significant discount for Azure VMs
	- Capacity **can be taken away at any time**
	- Customer can set maximum price after discount
- Best for **interruptable workloads** (batch processing, dev/test environments, large compute workloads, non-critical tasks, etc.)
