![[Pasted image 20231008215838.png]]

- Each service has its own SLA ranging from 99% to 99.999%
- Free services typically do not have an SLA
- Broken SLA means service credit return as discount

# Composite SLA

A combined SLA of **all components** in your application

# Factors that impact SLA and How to improve SLA

- Adding redundancy - Use the same service TWICE but with an OR operator
