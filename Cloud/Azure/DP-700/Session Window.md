# Session Window

Dynamically sized, based on activity gaps - A session ends when there is no new event for a specified time

Window ends and starts dynamically

Best for analyzing user behavior and sessions

Overlapping sessions can occur for different partitions - Two users can have active sessions at the same time

To answer these questions:

- How many websites visits were part of the same browsing session?
- How long does a machine remain active before downtime?
