An open-source storage layer that adds **relational database semantics** to Spark-based data lake processing

Tables in Fabric are Delta tables signified by the Delta (Î”) icon

Delta tables are just *schema abstractions* over files stored in Delta format

For each table the lakehouse stores a folder containing 

1. Parquet data files 
2. A `_delta_Log` folder with transaction details
