# Dataflows

A ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) cloud-based **tool** for to build execute scalable data transformation processes

A dataflow includes transformations to reduce data prep time and then can be loaded into a new table, which is included in a data pipeline, or used as a data source

Dataflows can be **horizontally partitioned**. A global dataflow can be used to create _specialized semantic models_

Dataflows help us reuse ETL logic to create more connections to our data sources
