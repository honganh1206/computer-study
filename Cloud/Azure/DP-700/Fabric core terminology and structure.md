# Fabric core terminology and structure

![[Pasted image 20250322145731.png]]

Fabric is deployed/enabled _per Microsoft Entra Tenant_ - No organization can bypass the use of tenants for workspace access and governance

Fabric is a data platform SaaS

## Workspace

**Workspaces** are **containers** for different Fabric items inside Fabric

Each workspace has **capacity** (compute resources + main costs) and is tied to a specific Fabric Capacity

We can group workspaces into **domains and sub-domains** for different business areas to manage data following specific regulations

## Items

Created within workspaces

Work as the building blocks of the platform

## Objects

Created within items like data stores e.g., tables, views, etc.
