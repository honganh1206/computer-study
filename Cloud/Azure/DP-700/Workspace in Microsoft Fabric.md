**Workspaces** are **containers** for different Fabric items inside Fabric

Each workspace has **capacity** (compute resources + main costs) and is tied to a specific Fabric Capacity and **its own set of permissions**

We can group workspaces into **domains and sub-domains** for different business areas to manage data following specific regulations

We can manage compute resources and integrate with Git for version control
