Let two non-negative integers $x$ and $y$ such that $0 \leq x, y < 2^w$ and each of $x$ and $y$ can be represented by a $w$-bit unsigned number. The sum of the two numbers would be $0 \leq x + y < 2^{w+1}-2$ as the maximum value for $x$ and $y$ a is both $2^w-1$.

When adding two $w$-bit unsigned numbers, the result may require $w+1$ bits to *fully represent the sum*, as the sum of two $w$-bit of maximum value might exceed $2^w-1$. An example would be if $w=3$, the maximum 3-bit unsigned number would be $111_{2}=7_{10}$, and the sum of two maximum 3-bit unsigned numbers would be $14 = 1110_{2}$, which is a 4-bit number.

Note that *some programming languages support fixed-size arithmetic*, so some operations like addition and multiplication differ from their counterpart mathematical arithmetic operations over integers e.g., overflow

```c
unsigned int x = 4294967295;  // 32-bit max value (2^32 - 1)
x += 1;  // Overflow: wraps back to 0
```
