For every number $x$ in the range $T\text{Min}_{w} \leq x \leq T\text{Max}_{w}$, we will have $-^{t}_{w} \\ x$ as follows:

## Principle

$$
-^{t}_{w}x = 
\begin{array}{rcl}
& T\text{Min}_{w}, & x = T\text{Min}_{w} \\
& -x, & x > T\text{Min}_{w}
\end{array}
\quad \text{(2.15)}
$$

For $w$-bit two's-complement addition, $T\text{Min}_{w}$ is its own additive inverse, while any other value $x$ has $-x$ as its additive inverse.

## Derivation

The special case is when $x = T\text{Min}_{w}$: We can see that $T\text{Min}_{w} + T\text{Min}_{w} = -2^{w-1} + -2^{w-1} = -2^{w}$ which *causes negative overflow* so truncation kicks in and $T\text{Min}_{w} + ^{t}_{w} \\ T\text{Min}_{w} = 0$

For $x$ such that $x > T\text{Min}_{w}$, $-x$ can be represented as a $w$-bit two's-complement number and $x + (-x) = 0$ is preserved in two's-complement arithmetic.
