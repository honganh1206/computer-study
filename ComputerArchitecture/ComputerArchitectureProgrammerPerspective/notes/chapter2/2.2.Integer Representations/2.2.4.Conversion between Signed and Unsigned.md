*C allow casting between different numeric data types*. But what about the effect of casting? The answer is *based on a bit-level perspective* rather than a numeric one.


```c
short int v = -12345;
unsigned short uv = (unsigned short) v;
printf("v= %d, uv = %u\n", v, uv); // v= -12345, uv = 53191 

```

[[The bit values are kept identical - We only change how the computer interprets the values]]
