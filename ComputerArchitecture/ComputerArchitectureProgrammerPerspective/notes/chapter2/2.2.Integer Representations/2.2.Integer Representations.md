We explore *two different ways* we use bits to *encode integers*: One to represent non-negative numbers (unsigned), and the other to represent negative, zero and positive numbers (signed). Both approaches share *mathematical properties* and *machine implementations*. 

We also investigate the effect of *expanding/shrinking an encoded integer* to fit the representation of a different length.
