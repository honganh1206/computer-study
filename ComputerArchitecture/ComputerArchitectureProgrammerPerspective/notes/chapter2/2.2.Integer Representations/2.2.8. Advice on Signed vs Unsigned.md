As said in [[Non-intuitive behaviors when C handles expressions between signed and unsigned]], we must be aware that casting often takes place without clear indication in the code and thus not  overlooking its effects.

A good practice is *not to use unsigned numbers*, and few languages other than C support unsigned numbers. 

Unsigned values are useful when we interpret words as *collection of bits* with no numeric interpretation. System programmers will also find unsigned values useful as *addresses are naturally unsigned*. Unsigned values are also useful in mathematical packages in which numbers are represented by array of words.
