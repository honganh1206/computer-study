What if we can *reduce the number of bits* representing a number? An example would be truncating a 32-bit `int` to a 16-bit `short`

When truncating a $w$-bit number like $\vec{x} = [x_{w-1}, x_{w-2}, \dots, x_{0}]$, we drop the high-order $w-k$ bits and the resulting bit vector would be $\vec{x'} = [x_{k-1}, x_{k-2}, \dots, x_{0}]$
