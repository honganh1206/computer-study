If a bit $x_{i}$ is set to 1, the bit $i$ contributes $2^i$ to the value. For example, the binary number $1011_{2}$ has the numeric value of $1 \times 2^{3} + 0 \times 2^{2}+ 1 \times 2^{1} + 1 \times 2^0=11$.

We can see that the numeric value associated with the bit vector equals the *sum of the lengths of the blue bars* with the corresponding bit values as 1.
