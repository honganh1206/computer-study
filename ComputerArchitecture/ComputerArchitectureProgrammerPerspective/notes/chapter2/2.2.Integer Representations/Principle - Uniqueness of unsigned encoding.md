Function $B2U_{w}$ is **bijection** meaning it can operate in reverse with $y = f(x)$ and $f(x) = y$. This is given by the **reverse function $f^{-1}$** for example $x = f^{-1}(y)$.

The reverse function of $B2U_{w}$ is $U 2 B_{w}$ (unsigned to binary) that *maps each number in the range $0$ to $2^{w-1}$* to unique patterns of $w$ bits.
