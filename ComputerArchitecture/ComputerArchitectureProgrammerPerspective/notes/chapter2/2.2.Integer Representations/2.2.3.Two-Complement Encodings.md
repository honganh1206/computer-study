The two’s-complement form allows us to *represent negative values/signed numbers*. We define this by *interpreting the most significant bit of the word to have negative weight*. We express this interpretation as a function $B2T_{w}$ (Binary to two’s-complement of length $w$)

The term “two’s-complement” comes from the fact: For non-negative number $x$, we compute a $w$-bit representation of $-x$ as $2^{w}-x$ (a single two)


```c
short x = -12345; // 1001110000001100
short mx = -x; // 1110001111110011
short ux = 53191; // 1110001111110011
show_bytes((byte_pointer) &x, sizeof(short));
show_bytes((byte_pointer) &mx, sizeof(short));
show_bytes((byte_pointer) &ux, sizeof(short)); // mx and ux share the same bit representation

```
