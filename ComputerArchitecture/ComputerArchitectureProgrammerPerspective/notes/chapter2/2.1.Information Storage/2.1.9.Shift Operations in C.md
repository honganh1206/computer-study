The **shift** operations allow *shifting bit patterns to left and right*. For example, with an operand $x$ with the bit representation of $[x_{w-1},x_{w-2},\dots,x_{0}]$, the C expression of `x << k` will yield a value with a bit representation of $[x_{w-k-1}, x_{w-k-2},\dots,x_{0}, 0, \dots,0]$.

What it means is that **$x$ is shifted $k$ bits to the LEFT**, the $k$ most significant bits are removed and the right end of $x$ is filled with 0 for $0 < k < w-1$.

Shift operations associate from left to right, meaning `x << j << k` is equivalent to `(x << j) << k`

[[The right shift operation behaves a bit differently]]

> [!NOTE] Most & Least significant bits
> In a byte like `00000101`, the most significant bit is the **leftmost**, as it has the highest value ($2^{7}= 128$). We can think of this as LAMS (Left Are Most Significant) and RALB (Right Are Least Significant)
