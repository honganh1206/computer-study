Bit vectors are strings of 0s and 1s of some fixed length $w$. Each element in a vector can be either 0 or 1 representing binary states, and each element represents the **index** of a value in a specific set (0 means not included and 1 means included)

$$
b: {\{0\dots, l-1\}} \to \{0,1\}
$$

Supposed we have two bit vectors $a$ $b$ of length $w$. We will have $a\land b$ where the $i$th element equals $a_{i} \land b_{i}$ for $0 \leq i \leq w$
