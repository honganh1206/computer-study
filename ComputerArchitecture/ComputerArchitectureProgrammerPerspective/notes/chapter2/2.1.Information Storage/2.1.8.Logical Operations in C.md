C offers **logical operators** namely `||, && , !` which correspond to bit-level operators like `|, &, ~`. However, the difference is the logical operators *treat any non-zero arguments as TRUE and argument 0 as false*

| Expression                   | Result       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| !0x41 (65 or True)           | 0x00 (False) |
| !0x00 (False)                | 0x01 (True)  |
| !!0x41                       | 0x01         |
| 0x69 (True) && 0x55 (True)   | 0x01         |
| 0x69 (True) \|\| 0x55 (True) | 0x01         |
