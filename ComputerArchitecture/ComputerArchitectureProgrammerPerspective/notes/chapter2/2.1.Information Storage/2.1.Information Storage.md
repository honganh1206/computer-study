- The binary digits form the basis of our digital revolution.
- While using the base-10 decimal notation (from 0 to 9) is more natural for us, binary values work better with computers
- As two-valued signals are **readily and easily** represented, stored and transmitted, *performing calculation on such signals is simple* thus enabling manufacturers to integrate billions of binary circuits on a single chip
- [[What a group of bits can do]]
- [[Three important representations of numbers]]
- [[Bit overflow]]


In this chapter, we go from: Basic definitions of encodings → The range of representable numbers → Their bit-level representation → The properties of arithmetic operations.


> [!tip] 
> We need to have an **abstract viewpoint**, as we must understand *how computer arithmetic relates to familiar integer and real arithmetic*.



> [!info] C++ and C
> C++ and C share the exact numeric representations and operations, and everything stated in this chapter holds true for both languages.
