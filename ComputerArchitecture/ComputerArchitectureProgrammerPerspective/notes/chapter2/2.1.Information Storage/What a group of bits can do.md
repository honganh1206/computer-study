- A single bit is not really useful, but if we *group bits together* and *apply some interpretation,* we can *give meaning to different bit patterns* and *represent the elements of any finite sets*
	- Example: Using a binary system number allows us to *group bits to encode non-negative numbers* by assigning each bit a specific positional value based on the power of 2 (1011 with $1 * 2^{3} + 0 * 2^{2}+ 1 * 2^{1}+ 1 *2^{0}= 11$)
