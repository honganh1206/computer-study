- What we learn: The **fundamental** properties of *how numbers and other data forms are represented on a computer* & *how properties of the operations computers perform on such data*.
- To help you better understand:
	- ðŸ”¥ First state property is represented as *principle* in mathematical notation (overflow as $x \mod{2^{32}} = y$) with **exercises** and *informal discussion* => It is the best practice to **go back and forth between statements and examples**
	- ðŸ”¥ Complex properties are provided with **derivation** structured like mathematical proof


> [!important] 
> As you proceed through presentation, you should **diligently** work on the practice problems, which is *within reach of someone with a good grasp of high school algebra.*
