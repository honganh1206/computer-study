$$
1×2^7+1×2^6+1×2^5+1×2^4+1×2^3+1×2^2+1×2^1+1×20 =128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255= 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255=128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255
$$

In decimal, each digit is expressed using **digits from 0 to 9**, and each place value represents **the power of 10**

$$
1×10^2+2×10^1+3×10^0=100+20+3=123
