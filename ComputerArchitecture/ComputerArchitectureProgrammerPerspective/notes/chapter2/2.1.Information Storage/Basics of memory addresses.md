Most computers use **blocks of 8 bits (bytes)** as the *smallest addressable unit of memory*. Virtual memory (how a program views memory) is represented as a **very large array of bytes**.

Each byte has an **address** and it is defined as a **unique number**. A set of all possible addresses is known as the **virtual address space**


> [!info] Actual implementation
> The actual implementation of the virtual address space is much more complex, as it includes **DRAM, flash memory, disk storage, special hardware and OS software** to provide a monolithic byte array.
