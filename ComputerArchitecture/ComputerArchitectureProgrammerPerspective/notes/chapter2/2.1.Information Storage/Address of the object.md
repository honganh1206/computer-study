In most machines, a multiâ€“byte object is **stored as a contiguous sequence of bytes** with the **address given by the smallest address of the bytes used** 

For example, if a variable `int x`  of 32-bit representation has address `0x100` i.e., the value of `&x` is `0x100` then *the 4 bytes of `x` will be stored in `0x100, 0x101, 0x102, 0x103`*
