A single byte consists of 8 bits ranging from 00000000<sub>2</sub> to 11111111<sub>2</sub> (the <sub>2</sub> represents the **binary format**). When viewed as a decimal integer, its value ranges from 0<sub>10</sub> to 255<sub>10</sub> (the <sub>10</sub> represents the **decimal format** or **base-10**)

However, both notations are not convenient to describe bit patterns, so we write but patterns as **base-16** or **hexadecimal numbers**.
