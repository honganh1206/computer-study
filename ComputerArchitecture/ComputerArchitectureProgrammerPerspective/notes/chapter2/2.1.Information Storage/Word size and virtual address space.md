[[What is a word size]]

As a virtual address is encoded by such a word size, *the most important system parameter determined by the word size is the maximum size of the virtual address space*

For a machine with a $w$-bit word size, the virtual addresses can range from *0 to $2^{w}-1$* and the program can access to **at most** $2^w$ bytes
