Most Intel-compatible machines operate *exclusively in little-endian mode*, while most machines from IBM and Oracle *prefer big-endian mode*. However, some IBM and Oracle manufacture machines using Intel-compatible processors are little-endian.

Some modern microprocessor chips are **bi-endian**, meaning they can be configured to operate as *either little- or big-endian*.

In general, byte ordering is fixed once a particular OS is chosen. OSes for phones like Android and iOS operate **only on little-endian mode**
