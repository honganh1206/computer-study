We will learn:
- How the compiler and run-time system *partitions the virtual address space into more manageable units* to store different program objects
- Why the value of a pointer in C is *the virtual address of the 1st byte of some block of storage*
- Why the actual machine level simply *treats program objects as blocks of bytes and has no information about data types in C*
