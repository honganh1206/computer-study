1. Compactness: Hexadecimal helps **shorten** the representation better than binary numbers.
2. Efficiency: Hexadecimal provides a clear and manageable way to *understand memory addresses*.
3. Alignment with binary architecture: Computer systems are built on power of 2 (binary) and *hex digit can be mapped directly to four digits*. This direct mapping is useful in tasks such as bitwise operations.
4. Ease of debugging: Hexadecimal allows programmers to work with large binary numbers in a more readable format
