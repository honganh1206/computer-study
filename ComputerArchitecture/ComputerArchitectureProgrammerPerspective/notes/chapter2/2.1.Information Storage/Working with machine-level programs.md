When working with machine-level programs, we usually *manually convert between decimal, binary and hexadecimal representations of bit patterns*.


> [!tip] Doing conversion in your head
> You should try to memorize the decimal equivalents of hex digits *A (1010), C (1100) and F (1111)*, and the hex values of B, D and E can be translated by *computing their values relative to the first three*.
