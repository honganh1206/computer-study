Instruction-Level Parallelism is a property of modern processors that allows *multiple instructions to be executed at one time*.

Early microprocessors required multiple (3-10) clock cycles to execute **a single instruction**, while recent processors can execute 2-4 instructions per clock cycle.

Although a single instruction take roughly 20 cycles to finish, the processor **uses a clever trick (pipelining)** to process as much as 100 instructions at a time.
