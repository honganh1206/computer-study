> - Amdahl’s Law allows us to calculate **the speedup** of the entire system when we improve a component of such system.
> - **Concurrency** and **Parallelism** allow computers to *do more work* and *do it faster* at lower levels like **thread-level concurrency** (multiple control flows within a single process), **instruction-level parallelism** (multiple instructions done in one clock cycle), and **single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) parallelism** (single instruction triggers multiple operations).
> - **Abstractions** are an important concept in computer systems as they allow us to **separate** the elaborate innerworkings of a hardware component from how they interact with the OS.


A system is more than just hardware: It is a **collection** of intertwined hardware and system software, and both aspects must cooperate to run application programs.
