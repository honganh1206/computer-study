# Programs are translated by other programs into different forms

> - To be executed by a computer and stored in a disk, source programs written in C must be translated to a low-level machine-language instructions.
> - Steps: A C text file is first **pre-processed** with a header file, then the output will be **compiled** to an assembly-language program. The **assembler** will then translate the machine-like instructions to a relocatable object while a linker will link other relocatable objects with the our object.

- The `hello.c` program is only readable for human, and it must be translated into a **sequence of low-level machine-language instructions**.
- Translated instructions are then packaged to become **executable object program** and stored as a **binary disk file**

## 4 phases of the compilation system:

### Pre-processing 

The `#include <stdio.h>` line tells the pre-processor to read the contents of `stdio.h` and insert it into the program text

### Compilation

The compiler translate the `hello.i` into `hello.s` containing *assembly-language program* - a common output language for different compilers and high-level languages

```assembly
1 main:
2 subq     $8, %rsp
3 movl     $.LC0, %edi
4 call     puts
5 movl     $0, %eax
6 addq     $8, %rsp
7 ret
```

### Assembly

The assembler translate `hello.s` into machine-language instructions packaged in the form of a *relocatable object program* and store the result in the object file `hello.o`

### Linking

The linker merges the `printf.o` precompiled object file with our `hello.o` so that we can use the `printf()` function => A `hello` file which is executable by the system
