# It pays to understand how compilation systems work


## Reasons to understand how compilation system works

1. Optimize program performance: Good coding decisions come from how we understand the compiler translates statements into machine code
2. Understand link-time errors
3. Avoid security holes: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities remain a nuisance over many years as programmers understand little the need to *carefully restrict the quantity + forms of data they accept from untrusted sources*
