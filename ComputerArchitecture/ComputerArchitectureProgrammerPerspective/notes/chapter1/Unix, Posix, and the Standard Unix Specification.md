A group of Bell labs researchers began working on a simple OS to replace the complex Multics called Unix. Berkeley researchers then added virtual memory and the Internet protocols in a series of releases called Unix 4.BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution).

After Unix vendors tried to differentiate themselves by adding new but incompatible features, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) *sponsored an effort named Posix to standardize Unix* => Posix standards that covers issues like the C language interface, shell programs and utilities, threads and network programming.
