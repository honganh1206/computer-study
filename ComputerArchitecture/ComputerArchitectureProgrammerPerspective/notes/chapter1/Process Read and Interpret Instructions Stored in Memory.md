# Process Read and Interpret Instructions Stored in memory

> [!summary] 3-sentence summary
> - A system consists of three categories of components: Components to handle inputs and outputs (Controller + Adapters), those who handle data transfer (Buses) and the rest to handle instruction storage and execution (PC, register file and ALU).
> - The main memory is responsible for storing the data from the inputs in a form of a sequence of bytes (think of it as a SQL Server database), while the register file stores the data ready to be processed by the ALU (similar to Redis)
> - The processor will execute the machine-language instructions with the ALU (think of it like the code you write to handle logic) on the **main** routine of the program then display the result to the user.


- The **shell** is **an application program** and **a command-line interpreter** that waits for you to type a command line before executing the command
- How the shell executes the executables: It first check if the command corresponds to  built-in shell command â†’ If not then the shell loads the program then run it
