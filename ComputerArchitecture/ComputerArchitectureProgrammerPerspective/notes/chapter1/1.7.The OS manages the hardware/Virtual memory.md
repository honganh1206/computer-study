An **abstraction** that provides each process with the **illusion** that *each process has an exclusive use of the main memory*.

Each process has a **virtual address space** (an uniform view of memory)

While the topmost region is for **code and data in the OS that is common to all processes**, the lower region holds the **code and data defined by the user’s process**

The virtual address space consists of certain areas with some of these lowest areas:
- [[Program code and data]]
- [[Heap]]
- [[Shared libraries]]
- [[Stack]]
- [[Kernel virtual memory]]

The virtual memory works by **a series of interactions** between the hardware and the OS, one of them is the hardware translates every address generated by the processor.

> Contents of a process’ virtual memory is stored on disk and we use the main memory (RAM) as a cache for the disk. => Frequently accessed data will be stored in the main memory, while the slower one is on disk. (More on [[Chapter 9]])
