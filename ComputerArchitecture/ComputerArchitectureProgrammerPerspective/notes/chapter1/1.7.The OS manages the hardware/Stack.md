The compiler uses the top of the userâ€™s address space as the *user stack* to implement function calls. 

The stack can also *expand and contract dynamically during runtime* e.g., the stack grows and contracts during recursion (call function until reaching the base class, then return from a function).

More of this in [[Chapter 3]]
