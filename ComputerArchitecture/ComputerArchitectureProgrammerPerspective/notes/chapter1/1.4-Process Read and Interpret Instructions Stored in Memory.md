# Process Read and Interpret Instructions Stored in memory

> [!summary] 3-sentence summary
> - A system consists of three categories of components: Components to handle inputs and outputs (Controller + Adapters), those who handle data transfer (Buses) and the rest to handle instruction storage and execution (PC, register file and ALU).
> - The main memory is responsible for storing the data from the inputs in a form of a sequence of bytes (think of it as a SQL Server database), while the register file stores the data ready to be processed by the ALU (similar to Redis)
> - The processor will execute the machine-language instructions with the ALU (think of it like the code you write to handle logic) on the **main** routine of the program then display the result to the user.


- The **shell** is **an application program** and **a command-line interpreter** that waits for you to type a command line before executing the command
- How the shell executes the executables: It first check if the command corresponds to  built-in shell command → If not then the shell loads the program then run it

## Hardware Organization of a System

![[F1.4-Hardware organization of a typical system.drawio.svg|Hardware organization of a typical system]]

### Buses

- Responsible for carrying fixed-size chunks of bytes of information (words) back and forth between components
- Word size is the **number** of bytes in a word: Most machines today has either word sizes of 4 bytes (32 bits) or 8 bytes (64 bits)

### I/O Devices

- Help our devices connect to the external world (keyboard, mouse, display, disk)
- I/O devices are connected to I/O bus to transfer data back and forth by either:
	- Chip sets in the device or on the system’s motherboard (Controllers)
	- A card that plugs into a slot on the motherboard (Adapter)

### Main memory

- A **temporary** storage device holding a program + the data the program manipulates while the processor is executing the program
- Consists of a **list** of *dynamic random access memory* (DRAM) chips
- Memory is organized as a **linear array of bytes**
- Each machine instruction constituting a program can consist of a varying number of bytes
- Data items in C vary according to type (`short` needs 2 bytes/ `int` and `float` need 4 bytes/`long` and `double` need 8 bytes - x84-64 machine running Linux)

### Processor 

- CPU is the **engine** that interprets the instructions stored in the main memory
- Core: Word-size storage device (register) called the **program counter** (PC) that is responsible for *pointing* at machine-language instructions in the main memory
- The processor follows a simple instruction execution model defined by its **instruction set architecture**:
	- (In short) The processor **repeatedly executes** instructions pointed at by the PC and **updates** the PC to point to the next instruction
	- (In detail) Executing an instruction involves steps
		1. The processor reads the instruction pointed by the PC then interprets the bits in the instruction + perform operation dictated by the instruction
		2. The processor updates the PC to point to the next instruction (NOTE: the next instruction might not be contiguous in memory to the just-executed instruction)
- Register file stores a **collection of unique word-size registers**
- The Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU) computes new data and address values (Actually responsible for executing the instructions)
- Examples of simple operations:
	1. **Load**: Copy a byte/word *from main memory → a register* >< Store: Copy a byte/word *from a register to a location in main memory* (both operations overwrite the previous content of the register/location)
	2. **Operate**: Copy the contents of two registers to the ALU → Perform an arithmetic operation on the two words → Store the result in a register + overwrite the previous contents of that register
		- Example: `ADD R3, R1, R2` means *adding the values in `R1` and `R2` and storing the result in `R3`* with the content of `R1` as 5 and `R2` as 7 → Perform the addition `5 + 7 = 12`
	3. **Jump**: Extract a word from the instruction → Copy that word into the PC + overwrite the previous value of that PC
		- Example: `JMP 0x0040` means jumping to Address `0x0040`
			- The CPU fetches the instruction `0001 (JMP instruction) 0000 0000 0100 0000 0000 (0x0040 - target address)`from the memory → PC holds the new value *`0x0040` as the target address* → The CPU will later fetch the instruction from the address `0x0040`

## Running the `hello` program

1. When we type `./hello`, the shell program reads *each character* into a register then stores it in memory
2. (Figure 1.5) When we hit enter: The shell loads the executable `hello` file from the disk → main memory by *executing a sequence of instructions*
3. (Figure 1.6) The data travels directly from disk to main memory *without passing through the processor* using **direct memory access** (DMA - more in chapter 6) -

4. (Figure 1.7 - Pre-condition: Code and data loaded into memory) The processor executes the machine-language instructions in the program’s **main** routine: Copy the bytes from `hello, world\n` string from memory to the register file → to display device → displayed to user
